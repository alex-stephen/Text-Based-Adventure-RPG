#This project was written by SamB KierraG and AlexS in Practical Software Development at the University of Lethbridge

#The goal of this assignment was to use proper Software design and structure ultilizing patterns and conventions.

#If you get Stuck on any of the riddles consider googling them, however we chose to make them fairly easy.

#I have also included minor testing to verify that our code is working properly. It should be noted that I was not able to achieve 100% code coverage
