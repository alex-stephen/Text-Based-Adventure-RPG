# Text Based Adventure Game - Escape the Lost Keep

#This is an engaging, interactive text-based adventure game written in C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming and software design principles. In this game, players navigate through various rooms, interact with characters, collect items, and make decisions that lead to different unique endings. Designed to provide an immersive experience, this project demonstrates foundational principles in software development and highlights clean, modular code structure. Utilizes comprehensive unit testing with Google Test (gtest) to ensure game stability and reliability.

#Technologies
- Language: C++
- Programming Concepts: Object-oriented programming, design patterns, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
